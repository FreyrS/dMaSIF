        H = hidden_units is the dimension of the intermediate representation
        radius is the size of the pseudo-geodesic Gaussian window w_ij = W(d_ij)


        This affordable layer implements an elementary "convolution" operator
        on a cloud of N points (x_i) in dimension 3 that we decompose in three steps:

          1. Apply the MLP "net_in" on the input features "f_i". (N, I) -> (N, H)

          2. Compute H interaction terms in parallel with:
                  f_i = sum_j [ w_ij * conv(P_ij) * f_j ]
            In the equation above:
              - w_ij is a pseudo-geodesic window with a set radius.
              - P_ij is a vector of dimension 3, equal to "x_j-x_i"
                in the local oriented basis at x_i.
              - "conv" is an MLP from R^3 to R^H:
                 - with 1 linear layer if "cheap" is True;
                 - with 2 linear layers and C=8 intermediate "cuts" otherwise.
              - "*" is coordinate-wise product.
              - f_j is the vector of transformed features.

          3. Apply the MLP "net_out" on the output features. (N, H) -> (N, O)


        A more general layer would have implemented conv(P_ij) as a full
        (H, H) matrix instead of a mere (H,) vector... At a much higher
        computational cost. The reasoning behind the code below is that
        a given time budget is better spent on using a larger architecture
        and more channels than on a very complex convolution operator.
        Interactions between channels happen at steps 1. and 3.,
        whereas the (costly) point-to-point interaction step 2.
        lets the network aggregate information in spatial neighborhoods.

        Args:
            in_channels (int, optional): numper of input features per point. Defaults to 1.
            out_channels (int, optional): number of output features per point. Defaults to 1.
            radius (float, optional): deviation of the Gaussian window on the
                quasi-geodesic distance `d_ij`. Defaults to 1..
            hidden_units (int, optional): number of hidden features per point.

                instead of a 2-layer deep MLP? Defaults to False.
